##CodeBook

This codebook describes the data, variables and detailed the steps to clean up the data. 

##Data Description & Source File
The data comes from a group of 30 volunteers performing 6 activites(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). A total of 561 variables were measured. 
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
Data for the project is taken from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Datase

Download data as Project.zip and extract all files under folder UCI HAR Dataset

##Variables 
Assign each data to variables. 
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

##Steps to clean up the data and called the R script run_analysis.R
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set using cbind and rbind. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement by subsetting the merge_data using select
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set - The numbers under code are replaced with the full activity desciption taken from 2nd column of activities variable.  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from data set in step 4 using mean and saved the final output as "final_data1.csv"
