# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project-Assignment

This repository contains:

- README
- Code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data
- R script called run_analysis.R data to derive at a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- Outcome file called "final_data1.csv".

To run the R script, dplyr package needs to be installed. The script will download dataset online and transform it to produce the final outcome file.
